# ClockUltra
I spent way, way too much time making a clock app in VisualBasic

This was one of my first big, ongoing projects. I remember trying to upload this to Downloads.com, but the executable was 3MB, which was ~1MB over the upload limit. Had no idea what I could cut; the timer, or the calendar, or the attempts to tunnel through networks?

Circa ~1997
